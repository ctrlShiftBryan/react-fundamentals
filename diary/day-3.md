# 3.2 Interpolation

- children prop
- can self close tags because not html
- expression not statements for props
- props are interpalations

# 3.3 Spread props

- ...prop spreading
- last in wins <div className="nope" {...props} className="I Win">
- children syntax overrides children prop

# 3.4 Nesting JSX

- class vs className

- TIL chrome console $1 currently selected element

- html attributes vs properties (class vs className). react uses properties only
  not attributes (className, htmlFor)

# 3.5 Fragments

- <React.Fragment> || <>
- because we can't assing two things to React.createElement
